On windows machines, you can run the program by double-clicking 'run.bat'. 

Other operating systems should run 'java resources.setup', or the syntactic equivalent.

The program can be recompiled by running 'make.bat' (on Windows systems), or the equivalent (see the make file for details) on other operating systems.
